So like it says in the main.py docstring, this is a nifty little CLI tool that:

- Accepts a coding task (e.g., "math ain't mathing")
- Chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task, for example:
-- Scan the files in a directory
-- Read a file's contents
-- Overwrite a file's contents
-- Execute the Python interpreter on a file
- Repeats step 2 until the task is complete (or it fails)
